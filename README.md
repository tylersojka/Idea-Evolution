# Idea-Evolution
Welcome to Idea Evolution. The idea of this project is to see how the simple idea of an open sourced project evolves. 

My idea with this is to at the very least give new developers and analysts an opportunity to be involved with a growing opensource project from the ground up, instead of having to have production level skills to get features added to a project. 

With this, it should allow people from EVERY skill level to contribute anything they can to get some experience.

Outside of the initial few ground work nucleus decisions, the idea is to have some sort of majority vote on every decision. Or at the very least a vote on blocks of decisions. 

The idea is to get the project to a point where I no longer have any kind of control over any aspect of it, and is all automated in some fashion. For now I will be pressing the buttons the community votes to be pushed.

This could turn into anything. A tool, a business, a cat picture sharing web app deep within the heart of the dark web. 

The first community decisions will be made once this repo has been forked by 10 different individuals and 10 pull requests made.
 
The pull requests for this first round could be anything, but for the sake of getting things up and runnin, I think we should stick to editing the readme with the first suggestions on where this should go! Ideas for this could include a way to view all suggestions, a way to vote on suggestions, etc. real ground work stuff! or just thoughts or comments in general!
