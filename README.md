# Idea-Evolution
Welcome to Idea Evolution. The idea of this project is to see how the simple idea of an open sourced project evolves. 

Outside of the initial few ground work nucleus decisions, the idea is to have some sort of majority vote on every decision. 



The first community decisions will be made once this repo has been forked by 10 different individuals and 10 pull requests made.
